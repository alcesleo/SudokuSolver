# Low level code quality report

## Long functions (>30 lines)

Rare, but they do occur.

## Long lines

Almost all lines in source are below 80 columns, all of them are below 120 columns.
The templates are excluded, many of them exceed this limit.

## Uncommented code

All code seems to be commented where it's needed.

## Misleading comments

All comments seem to be up to date

## Commented out code

Found no code that is commented out

## Code duplication

Minor areas, all marked out with TODO/FIXME-comments.

## Inline documentation

Docblocks are almost always provided, sometimes they are missing because
they simply would not be useful, and sometimes they are merged to save space.
